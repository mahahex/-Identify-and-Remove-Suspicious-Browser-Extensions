# Working and Understanding of VPN

## Objective
Understand how a VPN (Virtual Private Network) functions and how it enhances online privacy, security, and unrestricted access to content.

## Description
A VPN encrypts your internet connection and routes it through a secure server, masking your IP address and location. It ensures secure data transmission, protects against hackers on public networks, and helps bypass geo-restrictions or censorship.

## How VPN Works

1. **Connection Initiation**
   - User connects to a VPN client and selects a server location.

2. **Data Encryption**
   - The VPN encrypts all outgoing data from the device.

3. **Secure Tunneling**
   - Encrypted data is routed through a secure tunnel to the chosen VPN server.

4. **IP Masking**
   - The VPN server assigns a new IP address, hiding the userâ€™s original one.

5. **Decryption**
   - Data is decrypted at the destination server and sent to the internet.

6. **Reverse Process for Response**
   - Incoming data goes through the reverse path and is decrypted by the VPN client.
